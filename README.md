# Shopping App Tutorial for Beginners - React, Strapi, Stripe E-commerce App

This is a tutorial on building a complete e-commerce app using React, Strapi, and Stripe. The tutorial is aimed at beginners who want to learn how to build a full-stack e-commerce application. The application will include a user interface built with React, a backend built with Strapi, and a payment system integrated with Stripe.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you will need the following:

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and React
- Node.js installed on your machine
- An account with Stripe

## Setting Up the Backend

We will start by setting up the backend with Strapi. Strapi is a headless CMS that provides a flexible and powerful API for building web applications.

1. Install Strapi by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   npm install strapi@latest -g
   ```

2. Create a new Strapi project by running the following command:

   ```
   strapi new my-project
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to select your preferred database, authentication method, and other settings.

4. Once the project is created, start the Strapi server by running the following command:

   ```
   cd my-project
   strapi develop
   ```

5. Your Strapi backend is now up and running. You can access the Strapi admin panel at `http://localhost:1337/admin`.

## Setting Up the Frontend

We will now set up the frontend using React. We will use create-react-app to create the project.

1. Create a new React project by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```

2. Install the following dependencies:

   ```
   npm install react-router-dom axios react-stripe-elements
   ```

3. Create the following folder structure inside the `src` directory:

   ```
   components/
   pages/
   ```

4. Create a `components` directory and add the following components inside it:

   - `Header.js`
   - `Footer.js`
   - `Product.js`
   - `Cart.js`
   - `CheckoutForm.js`

5. Create a `pages` directory and add the following pages inside it:

   - `Home.js`
   - `Products.js`
   - `Cart.js`
   - `Checkout.js`

6. Update the `App.js` file to include the following routes:

```jsx
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path:"/",
    element:<span>Home</span>
  },
  {
    path:"/products/:id",
    element:<span>Category</span>
  },
  {
    path:"/product/:id",
    element:<span>Product</span>
  },
])

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```

7. Your React frontend is now set up. Start the development server by running the following command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   You can now access the React app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Integrating with Stripe

We will now integrate Stripe to allow customers to make payments.

1. Create an account with Stripe at `https://stripe.com/`.

2. In the Stripe dashboard, navigate to the API keys section and copy the publishable key.

3. Add the following code to your.
